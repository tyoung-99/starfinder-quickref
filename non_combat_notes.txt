SKILL CHECKS
Balance (Acrobatics) - CRB, pg. 135
    This skill is used as part of a move action.
    Make an Acrobatics check to move across narrow surfaces and uneven ground without falling. A successful check allows you to move at half your land speed across such a surface. While balancing, you are flat-footed. If you fail the Acrobatics check to begin moving across a narrow surface or uneven ground, your move action ends at the point just before you’d need to begin balancing. If you fail the check while already balancing (having succeeded on a previous turn), you fall prone and the GM may rule that you start falling, depending on the type of surface you are moving across.
    If you take damage while balancing, you must immediately attempt an Acrobatics check at the initial DC. On a success, you remain balancing (and can continue to move if it is your turn). If you fail, you fall prone and, depending on the type of surface you are balancing upon, the GM can rule that you start falling.
    The DCs for Acrobatics checks to balance are based on the width of the surface you are traversing, but can also be adjusted based on environmental circumstances such as slope and surface conditions. Such modifiers are cumulative; use all that apply.
    Surface Width	            DC
    Greater than 3 feet wide*	0
    3–1 feet wide*	            5
    11–7 inches wide	        10
    6–2 inches wide             15
    Less than 2 inches wide	    20
    * No Acrobatics check is needed to move across these surfaces unless a DC modifier (see table below) increases the DC to 10 or higher.
    Circumstance	                            DC Modifier (Cumulative)
    Slightly obstructed (gravel, sand)	        +2
    Severely obstructed (cavern, rubble)	    +5
    Slightly slippery (wet)	                    +2
    Severely slippery (icy)	                    +5
    Slightly sloped (<45 degrees)	            +2
    Severely sloped (>45 degrees)	            +5
    Slightly unsteady (rough spaceflight)	    +2
    Moderately unsteady (jostled spacecraft)	+5
    Severely unsteady (earthquake)	            +10
    You can't take 20 on Acrobatics checks to balance.

Climb (Athletics) - CRB, pg. 136
    This skill is used as part of a move action.
    Make an Athletics to climb on any surface that is not perfectly smooth, including ceilings if they have handholds.
    If you succeed, you move at half your land speed across such a surface.
    If you fail by 4 or less, you make no progress. If you fail by 5 or more, you fall.
    You need at least two hands to climb, but you can cling to a surface with one hand to take some other action that requires only one hand.
    While climbing or clinging, you are flat-footed.
    If you have a climb speed, you receive a +8 bonus to Athletics checks to climb and don't need to attempt Athletics checks to climb except in hazardous circumstances.
    Object Being Climbed	                                                                                                            DC

    You can't take 20 on Athletics checks to climb.

Diversion (Bluff) - CRB, pg. 137
    This skill requires a move action.
    Make a Bluff check opposed by the Sense Motive check of the creature(s) you are attempting to beguile.
    If you succeed, you can either attempt the hide task of Stealth as if you had cover or concealment, or you gain a +10 bonus to perform the palm an object task of Sleight of Hand (your choice).

Escape (Acrobatics) - CRB, pg. 135
    To escape from restraints, make an Acrobatics check against a DC as determined below. Escaping from restraints can take 1 minute or more.
    Circumstance                DC
    Restrained by bindings/rope 20 + 1-1/2 × opponent’s CR
    Restrained by manacles	    30

Fly (Acrobatics) - CRB, pg. 135-136
    Make an Acrobatics check against the appropriate DC on the chart below to complete one of the following tasks.
    You receive a bonus or penalty to Acrobatics checks to fly depending on your maneuverability: a –8 penalty for clumsy maneuverability, no bonus for average maneuverability, or a +8 bonus for perfect maneuverability.
        Avoid Falling Damage - CRB, pg. 135
            This skill requires a reaction.
            If you are falling and can fly, you can attempt to negate the damage from the fall. If you fail, you fall normally. If you have perfect maneuverability, you can avoid falling damage automatically without attempting a check.
        Fly in Dangerous Wind Conditions - CRB, pg. 135
            This skill is used as part of a move action.
            In conditions of windstorm or higher (see chart below), you must make an Acrobatics check to stay aloft each time you move. If you fail this check, you cannot move. If you fail this check by 5 or more, you are blown 2d6 × 10 feet in the direction of the prevailing wind (or in a direction decided by the GM), and take 2d6 bludgeoning damage.
        Hover - CRB, pg. 135-136
            This skill requires a move action.
            Make an Acrobatics check to hover while flying. If you fail, you fall.
            If you have clumsy maneuverability, you can’t hover at all. If you have average maneuverability and at least 5 ranks in Acrobatics or if you have perfect maneuverability, you can hover automatically without attempting a check and it doesn't require a move action.
    Wind Conditions*                DC
    Light to moderate (0–20 mph)	15
    Strong (21–30 mph)	            17
    Severe (31–50 mph)	            19
    Windstorm (51–74 mph)	        27
    Hurricane force (75–174 mph)	33
    Tornado force (175+ mph)	    39
    * The DC increases by as much as 5 for choppy wind or airborne debris, or 10 for both.
    You can't take 20 on Acrobatics checks to fly.

Jump (Athletics) - CRB, pg. 136-137
    This skill is used as part of a move action.
    Make an Athletics check to horizontally or vertically jump a distance no greater than your remaining amount of movement.
    If you take a 10-foot running start just prior to the jump attempt, the DC is equal to the number of feet you are attempting to jump horizontally, or four times the number of feet you are attempting to jump vertically. Without a 10-foot running start, the DC doubles.
    If you fail the check, you fall. If you fail by 5 or more, you fall prone even if you don’t take any damage from the fall.
    Creatures with a land speed of 35 feet or more gain a +4 bonus to Athletics checks to jump. This bonus increases by 4 for every 10 by which a creature’s land speed exceeds 40 feet.
    Circumstance	                            DC Modifier (Cumulative)
    Slightly obstructed (gravel, sand)	        +2
    Severely obstructed (cavern, rubble)	    +5
    Slightly slippery (wet)	                    +2
    Severely slippery (icy)	                    +5
    Slightly sloped (<45 degrees)	            +2
    Severely sloped (>45 degrees)	            +5
    Slightly unsteady (rough spaceflight)	    +2
    Moderately unsteady (jostled spacecraft)	+5
    Severely unsteady (earthquake)	            +10
    You can't take 20 on Athletics checks to jump.

Lie (Bluff) - CRB, pg. 137
    This skill requires at least a full action, possibly more, unless the lie is quick and simple enough to be part of combat banter.
    If the creature is suspicious or attending carefully to your lie (as per the detect deception task for Sense Motive), the check is opposed by the Sense Motive check of the creature you are lying to; otherwise, the DC of this check is equal to 10 + the creature’s total Sense Motive skill bonus. If you succeed, the creature you are lying to believes you are telling the truth, at least until confronted with evidence to the contrary. The GM may determine that some lies are so improbable that it is impossible to convince someone they are true.
    The DCs for Bluff checks to lie are adjusted based on the target’s initial attitude toward you (see Diplomacy on page 139) as well as other circumstances determined by the GM (such as the plausibility of the lie).
    Initial Attitude	DC Modifier
    Hostile	            +10
    Unfriendly	        +5
    Indifferent	        +0
    Friendly	        –5
    Helpful	            –5

Pass Secret Message (Bluff) - CRB, pg. 137
    You can use Bluff to pass a secret message to an ally without others understanding the message’s true meaning. The DC of this check is 15 for simple messages and 20 for more complex messages, as determined by the GM. Those overhearing the message can attempt an opposed Sense Motive check to learn the gist of the message.
    You can't take 20 on a Bluff check to pass a secret message.

Swim (Athletics) - CRB, pg. 137; SAP #36. pg. 48
    This skill is used as part of another move action.
    Make an Athletics check to swim.
    On a successful check, you move half your land speed through water and similar fluids.
    If you fail the check by 4 or less, you make no progress. If you fail by 5 or more, you sink beneath the surface or sink deeper, and you must hold your breath or begin drowning.
    If you do not have a swim speed, for each hour you swim, you must succeed at a DC 20 Athletics check or take 1d6 nonlethal damage from fatigue. If you have a swim speed, you move at your full swim speed when swimming, receive a +8 bonus to all Athletics checks to swim, don’t need to attempt Athletics checks to swim except in hazardous circumstances (see table below), can always take 10 while swimming, and can also swim while taking the run full action to move up to four times your swim speed in a straight line thorugh water or similar fluids.
    Environmental Conditions	DC
    Calm	                    10
    Rough	                    15
    Stormy*	                    20
    Maelstrom*	                30
    Circumstance	                                        DC Modifier (Cumulative)
    Light debris or disruption	                            +2
    Heavy debris or disruption*	                            +5
    Swimming with a current*	                            +5
    Swimming against a current*	                            +10
    Swimming against a jet of liquid or a strong current*	+15
    * Hazardous circumstance; creatures with a swim speed must attempt a check in these conditions.
