LAND COMBAT
Standard Action - You can perform one standard action per turn. A standard action can be used to perform a move or swift action instead.
    Activate an Item - CRB, pg. 244
        Certain items need to be activated to have an effect. Unless otherwise noted, activating such an item is a standard action.

    Attack - CRB, pg. 244-245
        Making a single attack is a standard action.
        Melee Attacks
            With a melee weapon, attack a target within your reach. Add your Strength modifier to your melee attack rolls and your melee damage rolls.
        Ranged Attacks
            With a ranged weapon, attack a target within the weapon’s maximum range and in your line of effect. Add your Dexterity modifier to your ranged attack rolls, but not your ranged damage rolls.
            Range/Penalties
                An attack with a ranged weapon from a distance greater than its listed range increment takes a cumulative –2 penalty to the attack roll for each full or partial range increment of distance beyond the first.
                Unless otherwise stated, the maximum range for ranged weapons is 10 range increments, or 5 range increments for thrown weapons.
            Ranged Attacks With a Thrown Weapon
                With a thrown weapon or grenade, attack a target within the weapon’s maximum range and in your line of effect. Add your Strength modifier to your ranged attack rolls, and to your damage rolls with weapons with the thrown special property. Do not add your Strength modifier to damage rolls with grenades.
                If you miss on a ranged attack with a thrown weapon, the weapon lands in a random square or grid intersection as appropriate near your target. To determine where it lands, roll 1d8 and 1d4. The d8 determines the misdirection of the throw, with 1 falling short (off-target in a straight line toward the thrower), and 2 through 8 rotating around the target creature or grid intersection clockwise. The d4 determines how many squares away in that direction the weapon lands.
            Targeting a Grid Intersection
                When using a weapon with the explode special property or a thrown weapon that has an area effect, target a specific grid intersection on a tactical battle map, rather than a specific creature. Treat this as a ranged attack against AC 5.
            Critical Hits
                When you get a natural 20 on an attack roll, you hit regardless of your target’s AC. If the total result of your attack roll would hit the target anyway, the attack is a critical hit. On a critical hit, roll damage twice, each time with all your usual bonuses and including any additional damage from special abilities, then add the rolls together. Some weapons inflict a special effect on a target of a critical hit, in addition to dealing double damage.

    Cast a Spell - CRB, pg. 246
        Most spells require at least a standard action to cast. Spells that take more than a round to cast require a full action each round until they are complete.
        Casting While Threatened
            Provokes attack of opportunity, unless spell specifies otherwise. If attack hits/damages you, you fail to cast spell/lose spell slot

    Combat Manuever - As a standard action, attempt a combat maneuver. Target an opponent within your reach and make a melee attack roll against their KAC + 8.
        Bull Rush - CRB, pg. 246
            knock the target back 5 feet, plus 5 additional feet for every 5 by which the result of your attack roll exceeds the target’s KAC + 8. If an obstacle is in the way, the target stops at the obstacle instead.
